My profession includes developing the right mindset and testing the product with different aspects by looking at a product from different angles, and with different perspectives. I find bugs to improve the product quality and thus help in growing confidence regarding the product developed. By applying a number of ideas, I look at the bigger picture and understand how badly end users can handle the product and imagine what could be the end user’s expectations.

Software testing is an ocean and no matter at which point you are sailing your boat, you are surely going to face the strong winds and splashing waves. But ultimately, who wants to sit on the seashore and keep looking at boats? 
We destroy things only to improve them :)
